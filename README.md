# AI-Driven-Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction

This project uses machine learning to look at important health signs and figure out how likely it is that a person will get heart disease. The model learns to find trends that show a higher chance of getting heart disease by using a dataset with medical attributes like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and other important factors. The software can divide people into two groups: those with heart disease and those without; it learns this by using real-life medical data.
There are several steps in the creation process. Before any analysis can begin, the information is preprocessed by filling in missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Then, exploratory data analysis is done to look for trends and links between heart disease risk factors. These are then used to train and test various machine learning methods, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These are judged on their accuracy and performance using precision, recall, the F1-score, and the ROC curve. Tuning hyperparameters is another way to improve model performance.
